# birthday-card
My friends birthday was coming up and I wanted to give him (also a programmer) a special birthday card. I planned to write a birthday message in Javascript code and write it all down (yes, old fashioned with a pen) on the card. 

_Beceause of privacy reasons, the name and date of birth have been changed to a fictitious person._
